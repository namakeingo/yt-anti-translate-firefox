# Firefox Manifest V3 Port of YouTube Anti Translate
Source code of [YouTube Anti Translate - mv3](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/youtube-anti-translate-mv3/)

This is a port I made, mainly for my own use, of the Chrome extension developed by [zpix1](https://github.com/zpix1)

For this port, I used Manifest V3 (same as the Chrome version) and only very minor changes were needed at this stage to get everything to work as the original.

# YouTube Anti Translate

The Original Chrome Extension [YouTube Anti Translate](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yt-anti-translate/ndpmhjnlfkgfalaieeneneenijondgag) with source code at [https://github.com/zpix1/yt-anti-translate](https://github.com/zpix1/yt-anti-translate)

The creator was annoyed by YouTube changing video titles to poorly user-translated versions, so they made this Chrome extension to retrieve original titles and change them back.

I was even more annoyed by AI Autodub.

## Features

- Restores original video titles on YouTube (Title Anti-Translation)
- Restores original video descriptions on YouTube (can be toggled in settings "Untranslate description")
- Disables automatic audio translation (can be toggled in settings "Untranslate audio track")
- Untranslates YouTube Shorts audio and titles
- Works automatically without any configuration

## How to use

Just install it from the [Firefox Extensions Store](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/youtube-anti-translate-mv3/).

There's also a [Firefox Manifest v2 version](https://addons.mozilla.org/en/firefox/addon/youtube-anti-translate/) (maintained by [artisticfox8](https://github.com/artisticfox8/)). Unfortunately, it was last updated on Aug 2, 2024 and is missing features because of that, hence why I published my MV3 version.
